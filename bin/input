http://thesandwichhorror.blogspot.com/2010/06/delhi.htmlThere is this fat, jolly old man who is a really good friend to me. He is not fat from eating too much and laying about on the couch in front of the television. His fatness comes from eating hot and fresh jalebis, sneaking them out from the parcel when walking back home and immediately stuffing them into his mouth, blowing frantically because they are much too hot, yet enjoying them. His fatness comes from early morning Modern bread from Shankar Market with uncle-ji-ke-chhole, dark brown, nearly black from chai patta, downed after samose-garam. Thick, huge paneer de pakode and Roshan Di Kulfi ki kulfi falooda ishpecial. Paneer tikka at Khan Market. Lunches at Kake Da Kotel on Connaught Place, followed up by a treasured dessert at Wenger's or at Nirula's, often both. Chaats (Alu Tikki, Gol Guppe, Mixed Fruit Chaat, and so on) from the same old red-haired chap near Punjab Sweets and Roopak Pik-N-Pay at Ajmal Khan Road (he is still there, even today).This fat old man curses like the hordes of truck drivers that throng that tiny little dhaba where you get the best dal makhani (Even better than the Dal Bukhara, I say) and some of the best paratha, naan, roti, and other hardy, sustaining foods that keep those inner fires burning in the winter. He attends those all-nighter jaagrans not because he is a religious zealot, but because he loves the puri-halwa-kabuli-channa they serve up for the devotees all the time. He smokes bidis so strong, he is eternally surrounded by a cloud of smoke. He is, though, always generous, polite to a fault once you get past the rough and callused exterior, and always has some sweet or the other for the multitudes of kids that travel to and from their school (such a cruel school, forcing little boys to wear shorts till the 9th grade even in the chills of winter, yet such a happy school, letting kids go naughty and freeing them from unit tests till 6th, and exams till 9th) in his auto-rickshaw.This hoary old man is Delhi. The Delhi of my childhood; the Delhi of my memories; the scarcely-changed-at-heart Delhi that I returned to for a short while two summers ago. I'll be back with him someday, and that day, I shall be Happy.
